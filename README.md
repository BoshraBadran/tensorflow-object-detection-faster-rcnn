## Object Detection with Faster R-CNN and the TensorFlow Object Detection API

Thannks to https://github.com/Tony607/object_detection_demo for the intial demo!

## What you will learn

* How to load your custom image detection from Rofoflow (here we use a public blood cell dataset with tfrecord)
* Download base MobileNetSSDv2 model
* Set up training environment
* Configure training pipeline and train the model
* Export the trained model's .pb inference graph
* Use the saved model for inference

## Resources available

* [This blog post](https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-a-tensorflow-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/) walks through the tutorial
* This notebook provides the code neccesary for the tutorial [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wTMIrJhYsQdq_u7ROOkf0Lu_fsX5Mu8a)
* For reading purposes, the notebook is also saved here as Tutorial.ipynb
